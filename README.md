# ML Supervised Learning -- Loan Approval Using Random Forest


In this example, we will build a Random Forest classifier that can be used to predict the loan status (approve or deny) given a set of input features.

## Instructions

1. Reading the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Separating the features `X` from the target `y`. In this case, the loan status is the target.

3. Separating the data into training and testing subsets.

4. Scaling the data using `StandardScaler`.

5. Importing and instantiate an Random Forest classifier using sklearn.

6. Fitting the model to the data.

7. Calculating the accuracy score using both the training and the testing data.

8. Making predictions using the testing data.

9. Generating the confusion matrix for the test data predictions.

10. Generating the classification report for the test data.
